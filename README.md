This project proposal aims to analyze and annotate the research done by the FBI
on their analysis of Hate Crime statistics across the United States of America for the year 2020, which
was published on the FBI public database on 30th of Aug 2021. The motive of this research is to capture
information about the types of bias that motivate crimes, the nature of the offenses, and some information
about the victims and offenders.
On April 23, 1990, Congress passed the Hate Crime Statistics Act, 28 U.S.C. § 534, which required the
Attorney General to collect data “about crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion,
sexual orientation, or ethnicity.” The Attorney General delegated the responsibilities of developing the
procedures for implementing, collecting, and managing hate crime data to the Director of the FBI, who,
in turn, assigned the tasks to the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. Under the direction of the
Attorney General and with the cooperation and assistance of many local and state law enforcement agencies,
the UCR Program created a hate crime data collection to comply with the congressional mandate.
This R Studio Markdown aims to analyse data from 2020 of FBI’s Hate Crime Statistics with various key
parameters as a control variable and defend a hypothesis that
1. Most hate crimes with bias ‘Race/Ethnicity/Ancestry’ happened mostly at the target victim’s place of
residence the most, followed by Supermarkets to be the next. Minority people are not safe in their own
houses and public essential places like supermarkets in the US of A.
2. Most hate crimes are targeted toward Black victims the highest in US of A while the second highest
is not even a race, rather a broader classification called Sexual Orientation where the Victims have
various Sexual Orientations. This infers that the criminals in America hates the one race - Black more
than they hate an entire broader group of populous with various Sexual Orientations.
3. Among juvenile, minors and kids, the hate crime is seriously directed toward Black Juveniles more than
any other race present. With the second highest again not being another race but the entire victims
of various sexual orientations, White race in USA commits the most range of hate crimes against any
other race. The highest crimes are against other people and specifically Intimidation
4. Single Bias Incidents, Race Bias, African Bias are the leading bars showing which type of hate crimes
are the highest
5. More Juvenile Hate crime victims lead to more adult hate crime victims
6. White race commits the most number of direct targeted hate crimes like Murder, Rape, Intimidation,
followed by Black race being the second
7. Mean value of Known offenders is 600+ and intimidation is one of the biggest repeat offense
8. Known Offenders cause the most number of hate crimes.
In creating the program, the designers recognized hate crimes are not separate, distinct crimes; instead,
they are traditional offenses motivated by the offender’s bias. (For example, an offender assaults a victim
because of a bias against the victim’s race.) After much consideration, the developers agreed hate crime
data could be derived by capturing the additional element of bias in those offenses already being reported to
the UCR Program. Attaching the collection of hate crime statistics to the established UCR data collection
procedures, they concluded, would fulfill the directives of the Hate Crime Statistics Act without placing an
undue additional reporting burden on law enforcement.

Hate Crime is an active problem in current fast paced Workforce society where the motives of the crime in
retrospect with today’s ideals are plainly ridiculous. In the age where humanity has surpassed the Nuclear
era and is well into the information era, hampering common public workforce from all around the world
with baseless hate, racism and discrimination is something massively bizarre and counterproductive that our
species are still facing. Coming from the perspective of an author, who is a person of color, this research
stresses the importance of analysis of hate crime based on various parameters, to ensure systemic eradication
of this barbaric baseless hate. Though the research attempted by FBI is satisfactory, it doesn’t exactly
produce the right data points with which a potentially better organization or institution can better use to
curb this problem. One strong suggestion would be to review those hate crimes on a much deeper scale,
including potential factors such as the criminal’s mental history, childhood, past traumas, education level
and more.
